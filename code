 +-> opengl.c                            - All interactions with OpenGL are here. OpenGL should not be called outside this for simplicity.
 |    |
 |    +-> shader.c                       - Shader reading, compiling, uniforms functions.
 |    |     |
 |    |     +-> glsl/fragmentShader.glsl - The fragment shader. Contains ray marching implementation.
 |    |     |
 |    |     +-> glsl/vertexShader.glsl   - The vertex shader.
 |    |
 |    +-> fileio.c                       - Takes pixel bytes from memory and dumps them into a bmp file
 |
 +-> scene.c                             - Scene is defined and updated here.
      |
      +-> camera.c                       - Calculate edge rays from camera position and facing direction.
            |                            - Edge rays are used to interpolate between, when calculating what direction to cast the rays in.
            |
            +-> vector.c                 - Definitions of Vectors and functions to calculate with them.
